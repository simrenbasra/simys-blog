title: "12 Days of Data: Project Updates ðŸ““"
date: 2024-12-12
---

Throughout this project, Iâ€™ll be sharing regular updates on my progress every few days. 

In each entry, Iâ€™ll highlight my main goals, what Iâ€™ve accomplished, any challenges Iâ€™ve faced, and next steps. The project aim is to build a tailored Christmas story generator using Large Language Models (LLMs) from a set of user inputs.

## Day 1: 12/12

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective**

- To successfully connect to the Open AI API and start to send requests.

#### **âœ… Accomplished Tasks**

- Set up Open AI account and generated my API key.
- Set up a secure way to pass the API key using environment variables (as recommeded by OpenAI).
- Tested the connection to the API and model.
- Gained experience in using the Chat Completion objects.

#### **ðŸ›‘ Blockers/Challenges**

- No blockers as of yet.

#### **ðŸ‘£ Next Steps** 

- Design and build Streamlit to gather user inputs.
- Implement prompt engineering based on inputs from Streamlit.
- Display the model (gpt-4o) output in Streamlit.

## Day 3: 15/12

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective**

- To set up Streamlit app and begin prompt engineering with user inputs.

#### **âœ… Accomplished Tasks**

- Developed a basic Streamlit app to take user inputs such as character type and genre.
- Created two functions: one to build prompts from user inputs and another to get responses from GPT passing generated prompts as input.
- Added a button in Streamlit to display output of the GPT model.
- Added a button in Streamlit for users to download the stories.
- Experimented with different prompts and language to see the effects on the output.
   
#### **ðŸ›‘ Blockers/Challenges**

- No blockers. However for this project, I am ahead of schedule and may finish before Christmas Eve (12 days). 
  
#### **ðŸ‘£ Next Steps** 

- Refine prompts futher and explore tuning of the GPT parameters to increase the quality of the model's outputs.
- Improve on the design and user interface of the Streamlit app.

## Day 6: 18/12

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective**

- To build on the design of my web app and further refine the output of the GPT model by tuning parameters and further refining prompts.

#### **âœ… Accomplished Tasks**

- Added in some display features to make the web app more appealing to users while they wait for their story to be generated.
- Experimented with the different parameters of the GPT model to refine the output - with a close focus on temperature.
- Further refined the prompts.

#### **ðŸ›‘ Blockers/Challenges**

- No blockers but I will most likely finish the project by the end of the week.

#### **ðŸ‘£ Next Steps:** 

- The main focus for me now is to improve the web app and add in some formatting.
- Clean up the project repository as wrap up the project.

## Day 9: 21/12

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective**

To wrap up any loose ends of the project and improve Streamlit display.

#### **âœ… Accomplished Tasks**

- Added extra inputs for the user to enter to further personalise stories. 
- Added in a button where inputs are randomly selected, for cases where users does not want to choose inputs.
- Personalised Streamlit display.
- Refactored code and added in comments since the repository will be made public soon.

#### **ðŸ›‘ Blockers/Challenges**

- No blockers.

#### **ðŸ‘£ Next Steps** 

- To record video of Streamlit to show how the web app works.
- Repository to be made public on Christmas Eve.

## Day 12: 24/12

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective**
Deploy the Streamlit app for public use without requiring users to download the project repository.

#### **âœ… Accomplished Tasks**
- Attempted deployment using Streamlit Cloud.
- Debugged deployment issues related to libraries installed via conda.
- Reinstalled libraries but still encountered the same issues, possibly linked to Homebrew-installed packages.

#### **ðŸ›‘ Blockers/Challenges**
- Despite thorough debugging efforts, deployment using Streamlit Cloud was unsuccessful.

#### **ðŸ’¡ Reflection** 
- Going forward, I think it best to explore other ways to create and deploy apps outside of Streamlit. This will likely become my next project for the new year, as Iâ€™ve faced deployment challenges with Streamlit apps in previous projects as well.
- To write a blog post summarising key concepts of prompt engineering and sharing implementation steps of this project.
