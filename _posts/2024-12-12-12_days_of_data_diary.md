title: "12 Days of Data: Project Updates ðŸ““"
date: 2024-12-12

Throughout this project, Iâ€™ll be sharing regular updates on my progress every few days. 

In each entry, Iâ€™ll highlight my main goals, what Iâ€™ve accomplished, any challenges Iâ€™ve faced, and next steps. The project aim is to build a tailored Christmas story generator using Large Language Models (LLMs) from a set of user inputs.

## Day 1: 12/12

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective**

- To successfully connect to the Open AI API and start to send requests.

#### **âœ… Accomplished Tasks**

- Set up Open AI account and generated my API key.
- Set up a secure way to pass the API key using environment variables (as recommeded by OpenAI).
- Tested the connection to the API and model.
- Gained experience in using the Chat Completion objects.

#### **ðŸ›‘ Blockers/Challenges**

- No blockers as of yet.

#### **ðŸ‘£ Next Steps** 

- Design and build Streamlit to gather user inputs.
- Implement prompt engineering based on inputs from Streamlit.
- Display the model (gpt-4o) output in Streamlit.

## Day 3: 15/12

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective**

- To set up Streamlit app and begin prompt engineering with user inputs.

#### **âœ… Accomplished Tasks**

- Developed a basic Streamlit app to take user inputs such as character type and genre.
- Created two functions: one to build prompts from user inputs and another to get responses from GPT passing generated prompts as input.
- Added a button in Streamlit to display output of the GPT model.
- Added a button in Streamlit for users to download the stories.
- Experimented with different prompts and language to see the effects on the output.
   
#### **ðŸ›‘ Blockers/Challenges**

- No blockers. However for this project, I am ahead of schedule and may finish before Christmas Eve (12 days). 
  
#### **ðŸ‘£ Next Steps** 

- Refine prompts futher and explore tuning of the GPT parameters to increase the quality of the model's outputs.
- Improve on the design and user interface of the Streamlit app.
