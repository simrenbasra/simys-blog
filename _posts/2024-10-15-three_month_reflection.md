When I started my blog three months ago, I wasnâ€™t sure where it would take me. I simply wanted a space to share some of my projects and experiences in data but blogging has turned out to be far more useful than I expected. Over the last three months, Iâ€™ve learned a lotâ€”not only about the technical concepts Iâ€™ve been writing about but also how to better communicate these ideas with others. Now, it feels like the perfect time to reflect on my journey sharing the challenges and highlights faced in the past three months.

## Personal Growth

Reflecting on the past three months, Iâ€™ve seen substantial growth not only in my technical skills but also in my ability to communicate complex machine learning concepts. Since starting my blog, Iâ€™ve taken on personal projects that challenge me to step outside my comfort zone. For instance, in my last project, Sound Decisions, I created my own dataset which pushed me to learn web scraping.

Looking back at my first project, I felt quite uneasy. I was used to working from requirements set by clients or by following some sort of instruction. This time, I had to manage both the non-technical and technical aspects on my own. Now, I enjoy the freedom of developing my own projects based on what interests me!

## Highlights

So far in my projects and blog, I have tried to work on a mix of data topics. With each project, I have tried to show a different skill or explore something different. 

**Most Enjoyable Project**

I still think the Sign-Lingual project was the most fun for me to complete. I enjoyed how the project started using simple logistic regression on images and progressed to using more complex ideas like transfer learning. This approach allowed me to fully understand concepts as the project developed.

**Most Challenging Project**

The Time Series project must be the most challenging one for me. Completing it was fairly trying. I faced a lot of unknowns, from handling the volatility of stock data to selecting models for forecasting. This project taught me the value of pushing through challenges. Each hurdle has deepened my understanding and given me new skills when approaching complex problems.

## Challenges

Writing has been a great area of growth for me. While it takes several drafts to get things just right, I've learned that clear communication is a key skill, especially in data roles. 

One of the biggest challenges I've faced is balancing my personal projects, blog and job searching with my personal life. Data science is something I enjoy, but Iâ€™ve found myself getting so absorbed in it that I unintentionally neglect hobbies and social plans.

Over time, Iâ€™ve realised how important it is to create a structured routine to keep my work from spilling over into other areas of my life. While itâ€™s not always easy, especially when Iâ€™m deeply engrossed in a project, Iâ€™m learning to manage my time better. This includes setting strict working hours and scheduling time for hobbies and other activities. 

Moving forward, finding a balance that allows me to pursue my passion without burning out is a priority. 

## Looking Ahead

The plan is to keep blogging, keep coding and keep pushing forward!

Thereâ€™s still so much more to explore, but Iâ€™ve genuinely enjoyed every step of the journey so far. Despite some challenges, I have learnt a great deal and Iâ€™m excited about whatâ€™s next! I think that more people should know about the potential of data. My goal is to make data engaging and fun for everyone, showing that itâ€™s much more than just numbers and spreadsheets!
