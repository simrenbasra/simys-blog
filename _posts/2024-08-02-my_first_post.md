Hi, my name is Simren! 

I recently transitioned from a career as a software development consultant in fintech to pursue my passion for data science. With a background in computer science and an interest in knowing more about the world of data, I decided to do a three-month intensive bootcamp to jumpstart my journey into data science.

## My Background

My bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and AI has given me a strong foundation in programming, algorithms and data structures. For the past four years I worked as a software developer responsible for platform (Avaloq) implementation in addition to data reconciliation, migration and reporting. While I enjoyed my work, I wanted a new challenge. I remember when I was at university the topics I most enjoyed were those which involved machine learning and data analysis. Having now gained greater confidence in my coding abilities from my work experience, I decided to pursue a three-month bootcamp in data science. 

## Choosing the Bootcamp

I wanted a bootcamp with in-person teaching since I tend learn better in a classroom setting compared to online. After researching various bootcamps in London, I chose BrainStation. Its data science curriculum appeared to be the most comprehensive and seemed to align with what I wanted to learn in addition to offering a hands-on approach that I was looking for.

## Bootcamp Experience

The bootcamp covered a wide range of topics including Python/SQL programming, data wrangling, big data, machine learning and data visualisation. A key part of the bootcamp was completing a self-directed project to tie together concepts learnt. For my project, I chose to do a computer vision project and developed a machine learning model for interpreting sign language. I will be uploading a separate blog post to cover this project in further detail! 

Throughout the bootcamp, I gained proficiency in SQL and Python, including libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning. I also learned about big data technologies like Hadoop and AWS and explored advanced machine learning concepts such as neural networks, embeddings, and ensemble learning.

In addition to technical skills, I further developed my problem-solving and communication abilities, especially regarding translating data insights into meaningful business findings. 


## Future Plans

Since completing the bootcamp, I’ve been working on some personal projects to build out my portfolio. For an overview of my projects, please visit my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/simrenbasra).
Currently, I’m focused on refining the skills I have learnt and ensuring I have a solid foundation in data science. In the coming month, I will be looking for junior data scientist opportunities where I can apply all the skills I have developed and contribute to a team.

I am excited to see where my journey into data science leads. Although I’ve found parts to be challenging, I’m pleased to have found a career path that excites me as much as data science does. Every project I complete is enjoyable, and I look forward to having the opportunity to do this every day!
