## Gender Distribution

The Paris 2024 Olympics made history in terms of gender parity with women athletes having as many places in the Games as male athletes [3]. In this section, I will dive into the gender representation among athletes, exploring its trends and outcomes.
 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/athlete_gender.png" alt="Athlete Gender Proportion" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
</div>
 
**Athlete Gender Proportion:** The dataset I‚Äôm analysing also reflects an almost perfect gender balance, with 49% female and 51% male athletes. Now, let's explore whether this parity extends to the medallists as well.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/medallist_gender.png" alt="Medallists Gender Proportion" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
</div>
 
**Medallist Gender Proportion:** The data also reveals an even gender balance among the medallists, with a 50/50 split between female and male athletes.

  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/top_sport_by_gender.png" alt="Top Sports by Gender" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
</div>

**Top Sports by Gender:** The data highlights that while overall gender representation is balanced, certain sports still show uneven representation. Some sports show a slightly strong skew towards one gender such as swimming and football.

## Age and Performance

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/age_by_medal_type.png" alt="Age Distribution by Medal Type" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
</div>

### Age Distribution by Medal Type: 

- **Gold Medals:** Gold medallists typically range from ages 23 to 30. The age distribution is relatively consistent with fewer outliers compared to silver and bronze medals.
- **Silver Medals:** Silver medallists are mainly between 23 and 28 years old. There are more outliers in this category, suggesting some variability.
- **Bronze Medals:** Bronze medallists also show a concentration between 23 and 28 years, like silver medals. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/num_medals_by_age.png" alt="Number of Medals by Age" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
</div>

### Number of Medals by Age:

- **Peak Performance Age:** The line graph reveals that athletes tend to peak in their medal counts in their late 20s. This is consistent across gold, silver and bronze medals, indicating that this age range is optimal for peak performance.
- **Post-Peak Decline:** After reaching their peak in the late 20s, there is a noticeable decline in medal counts for silver and bronze medals in older age groups. This trend suggests that performance in these categories tends to decrease as athletes age.
- **Gold Medallists Secondary Peak:** Interestingly, gold medal counts show a smaller peak around age 30. This indicates that while the general trend is a decline after the late 20s, some athletes continue to achieve high performance and secure gold medals into their 30s. This trend may reflect results of some sports which benefit from greater experience and expertise.

## Logistic Regression Results 

Logistic regression is a machine learning method used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on predictor variables called features. In this analysis, I used logistic regression to identify factors that contribute to the likelihood of an athlete's success in the 2024 Olympics.

Before applying logistic regression, several data preparation steps were taken to ensure accurate and meaningful insights:

*Step 1: Feature Engineering*

  - **Sporting Relatives:** Original column was text based, describing a variety of relationships to the athlete. To me, the purpose of this column was to clarify if an athlete had a sporting relative. Therefore, I transformed the column to a Boolean data type simplifying the model without losing significant insight.
  - **Winning Athletes:** A new column, ‚Äòis_winner‚Äô was added to indicate whether an athlete won any medals.
  - **Age:** Calculated** from athletes‚Äô birthdates, the age column was included to assess how age influences performance. 
  - **Other Sports:** Initially a messy column with full sentences, was cleaned using regular expressions to extract only the sport names. 
  - **Plays Other Sports:** A simple boolean column indicating whether an athlete plays additional sports. 
  - **Has Ritual:** Converted values from the ‚Äòritual‚Äô column to a boolean value to indicate whether an athlete has a pre-race ritual. 
  
*Step 2: Feature Selection*

In selecting features for the logistic regression model, the following considerations were made:

  - **Relevance to Outcome:** Features directly related to athletic success, such as age and sporting relatives, were retained for their potential impact.
  - **Avoiding Data Explosion:** Features like events and education were excluded due to their high diversity of unique values which could potentially overly complicate the model.
  - **Handling Missing Data:** Weight column was dropped due to a high proportion of missing values and values which were 0.
  - **Future Analysis:** Features like hobbies, philosophy, and rituals were reserved for later, where I explore NLP.

*Step 3: Data Cleaning*
  - **Null Values:** The dataset was cleaned to ensure no null values remained.
  - **Height Values:** Zero values in the ‚Äòheight‚Äô column were replaced with the mean height based on gender to maintain accuracy.

### Logistic Regression Steps:

**1. Conversion to Numerical:** Categorical variables were converted to numerical values since all values must be numerical.
**2. Scaling:** Features were scaled to standardize their ranges. This step ensures that no single feature influences the model due to differences in scale.
**3. Splitting Data:** The dataset was divided into feature variables (X) and the target variable (Y).
**4. Building and Fitting the Model:** The logistic regression model was instantiated and trained using the processed data.
**5. Assessing Accuracy:** The model's accuracy was evaluated to determine its effectiveness in predicting outcomes.
**6. Evaluating Coefficients and Odds Ratios:** The model coefficients and odds ratios were analysed to understand the impact each feature had on the likelihood of success.

The table below summarizes the results of our logistic regression analysis, showing the coefficients and odds ratios for each feature: 

| Feature | Coefficient | Odds Ratio | 
|----------------------|-------------|------------| 
| Play Other Sports | 0.361081 | 1.434879 | 
| Sporting Relatives | 0.357770 | 1.430136 | 
| Scaled Height | 0.273702 | 1.314823 | 
| Has Ritual | 0.254909 | 1.290344 | 
| Scaled Age | 0.018152 | 1.018317 | 
| Gender Encoded | -0.294429 | 0.744957 |

### Interpretation 

  - **Play Other Sports**: The positive coefficient (0.361) indicates that playing other sports increases the likelihood of success, with an odds ratio of 1.435. This suggests that athletes who participate in a variety of sports have a higher chance of winning. 
  - **Sporting Relatives**: Having relatives involved in sports also positively affects success, increasing an athletes chance of winning by 1.43 units.
  - **Scaled Height**: Height positively impacts the likelihood of success by a factor od 1.315. 
  - **Has Ritual**: The presence of personal rituals contributes positively to success 
  - **Scaled Age**: Age shows a minimal positive effect on success, with a small coefficient of 0.018 and an odds ratio of 1.018. 
  - **Gender Encoded**: The negative coefficient for gender indicates that being male decreases the likelihood of success, with an odds ratio of 0.745.
