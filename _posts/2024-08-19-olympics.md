## Introduction

Every four years, the Olympics transforms the world into a stage where top athletes come together to amaze us with their skills. This year, athletes head to Paris to compete for gold, silver and bronze and of course, to be part of Olympic history! I've found some datasets on Kaggle[1] that include details about athletes offering us valuable insights into the secrets behind Olympic success.

In this analysis, I will explore:

- **Medal Distribution:** Analysing how medals are distributed by type and country.
- **Gender Representation:** Examining the gender distribution among athletes.
- **Top Performers:** Highlighting the medal counts of the leading athletes.
- **Age and Performance:** Investigating how age influences athletic success.
- **Logistic Regression:** Identifying key features that enhance the likelihood of success.
- **NLP Analysis:** Exploring hobbies, philosophies, and rituals of athletes to uncover common traits.

# Data Insights

## Overall Medal Leaderboard: Tableau Dashboard

Below is an interactive Tableau dashboard that showcases overall medal distribution across all countries. Use this dashboard to gain preliminary insights into the 2024 Olympics:

**Note:** AIN stands for "Individual Neutral Athletes," or "Athl√®tes Individuels Neutres" in French [2].  This designation refers to athletes from Russia and Belarus who compete under a neutral flag rather than representing their home countries

## Gender Distribution

The Paris 2024 Olympics made history in terms of gender parity with women athletes having as many places in the Games as male athletes [3]. In this section, I will dive into the gender representation among athletes, exploring its trends and outcomes.

**Athlete Gender Proportion:** The dataset I‚Äôm analysing also reflects an almost perfect gender balance, with 49% female and 51% male athletes. Now, let's explore whether this parity extends to the medallists as well.

**Medallist Gender Proportion:** The data also reveals an even gender balance among the medallists, with a 50/50 split between female and male athletes.

**Top Sports by Gender:** The data highlights that while overall gender representation is balanced, certain sports still show uneven representation. Some sports show a slightly strong skew towards one gender such as swimming and football.


## Top Performing Athletes
 
**Key insights:**

- **Simone Biles** and **Leon Marchand** dominate with multiple gold medals
- **Torri Huske** and **Regan Smith** stand out with a strong collection of silver medals.
- **Zhang Yufei's** achievement is particularly impressive, with five bronze medals to her name, demonstrating her ability to perform at a high level across various events.


## Age and Performance

### Age Distribution by Medal Type: 

- **Gold Medals:** Gold medallists typically range from ages 23 to 30. The age distribution is relatively consistent with fewer outliers compared to silver and bronze medals.
- **Silver Medals:** Silver medallists are mainly between 23 and 28 years old. There are more outliers in this category, suggesting some variability.
- **Bronze Medals:** Bronze medallists also show a concentration between 23 and 28 years, like silver medals. The distribution has a comparable range of outliers.

### Number of Medals by Age:

- **Peak Performance Age:** The line graph reveals that athletes tend to peak in their medal counts in their late 20s. This is consistent across gold, silver, and bronze medals, indicating that this age range is optimal for peak performance.
- **Post-Peak Decline:** After reaching their peak in the late 20s, there is a noticeable decline in medal counts for silver and bronze medals in older age groups. This trend suggests that performance in these categories tends to decrease as athletes age.
- **Gold Medallists** Secondary Peak: Interestingly, gold medal counts show a smaller secondary peak around age 30. This indicates that while the general trend is a decline after the late 20s, some athletes continue to achieve high performance and secure gold medals into their 30s. This trend may reflect results of some sports which benefit from greater experience and expertise.
