Hey, I’m Simy and I believe that data can be fun for everyone! 

From finishing a data science bootcamp to nearly a year as a junior AI engineer, I’ve been building AI projects, learning new things and figuring out how to make complex concepts simple for myself and others! This blog is where I share what I’m learning, give project updates and experiment along the way.

### My Background 

My bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and AI gave me a strong foundation in programming, algorithms and data structures. After several years working as a software developer, where I implemented platforms like Avaloq and managed data reconciliation, migration, and reporting, I realised I was ready for a new challenge. 

Reflecting on my time at university, the topics I enjoyed most were machine learning and data analysis. With increased confidence in my coding skills from professional experience, I decided to pursue a three-month data science bootcamp at [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/london) to dive deeper into AI and data.

### Data Science Journey 

At the start of this year, I began my first AI role as a Junior AI Engineer! Here, I work with a talented team focusing on building AI solutions for the Accounts Payable space. This includes model development, experimentation and implementing models into production. I really enjoy my job and feel very lucky to have made this transition.

There’s still a lot for me to learn in data science and general coding! My blog has been a great way to expand my knowledge and upskill on both traditional concepts as well as new techniques like vector search. I’m still growing in the field, and of course I make mistakes but I’ve learned that’s all part of the process!

I often hear people say, “Wow, working with AI must be so hard!” but it’s not as intimidating as it seems. I genuinely believe that if I can learn AI and complete projects, anyone can! That’s what I hope to show with my blog, AI doesn’t have to be complicated!

### Current Focus

Outside of my full-time role, I’m working on a new project called SimBot, a custom chatbot designed to help readers navigate my blog and posts. I’ve also launched my newsletter, Simy Says, aimed at complete beginners who want to build a better understanding of AI and machine learning. My aim is to still grow as an AI engineer and keep learning!
