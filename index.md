My name is Simy and I’m new to data science! After completing a data science bootcamp, I’m excited to apply the skills I’ve gained as I dive the world of data. I’ll be exploring the basics, tackling projects, learning as I go, all while sharing my journey and insights along the way. 

In this blog, I will be posting:

- **📖 Tutorials:** Discussions on data science concepts and techniques.
- **💻 Project Showcases:** Detailed write-ups of personal projects.
- **💡 Insights & Reflections:** Analysis and insights on trending events.

## Upcoming Posts

Here are some of the upcoming posts:
  
- **👐 Sign-Lingual:** Exploring some computer vision techniques I used to build my machine learning model for sign language recognition. I’ll break down how I developed different models, starting from a baseline logistic regression and progressing through various approaches, including transfer learning. I’ll explain the concepts behind each method and how they led to selecting the most effective model for sign language detection.

**(Expected: 26/08/24)**
