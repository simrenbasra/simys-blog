Hey, Iâ€™m Simy and I believe that data can be fun for everyone! 

After finishing a data science bootcamp, Iâ€™m excited to dive into the world of data and uncover some cool insights. Iâ€™ll be sharing my journey as I tackle projects, learn new things and show how exciting data can be!

### **12 Days of Data ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…** 

For my next project, I am diving into the world of LLMs (Large Language Models) to create short, tailored Christmas stories.

Given inputs such as characters and locations, the LLM will create personalised stories.

Iâ€™m challenging myself to complete this project in just 12 days! Follow along as I explore prompt engineering and share daily updates.
