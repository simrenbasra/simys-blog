Hey, I‚Äôm Simy and I believe that data can be fun for everyone! 

After finishing a data science bootcamp, I‚Äôm excited to dive into the world of data and uncover some cool insights. I‚Äôll be sharing my journey as I tackle projects, learn new things, and show how exciting data can be!

### **Email Genie üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**

A classification project where I explore the Enron dataset and experiment with clustering and classification models to group emails based on their content. This project will also include a web app where users can enter a dummy email to test the model in real-time.

_**Phase 1: Data Preprocessing & Initial Analysis**_

Clean and preprocess the Enron email dataset, removing noise such as email headers, stopwords, and irrelevant text. Extract meaningful features using TF-IDF and Word2Vec to gain preliminary insights into the content, identifying important tokens and potential groupings.

_**Phase 2: Clustering**_

Apply clustering techniques: K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models to group similar emails together. Analyse the clusters and compare performance between the different methods.

_**Phase 3: Classification Modelling**_

Use the clusters or other labeling methods (if clustering produces poor results) to train different classification models. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Use the best performing model in a web app where users can enter dummy emails to test the model's ability to classify emails.
