I'm Simy and I’m new to data science! After completing a data science bootcamp, I’m excited to apply the skills I’ve gained as I dive the world of data. I’ll be exploring data insights, tackling projects, learning as I go, all while sharing my journey along the way. 

In this blog, I will be posting:

- **📖 Tutorials:** Discussions on data science concepts and techniques.
- **💻 Project Showcases:** Detailed write-ups of personal projects.
- **💡 Insights & Reflections:** Analysis and insights on trending events.
