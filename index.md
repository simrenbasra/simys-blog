Hey, I’m Simy and I believe that data can be fun for everyone! 

After finishing a data science bootcamp, I’m excited to dive into the world of data and uncover some cool insights. I’ll be sharing my journey as I tackle projects, learn new things, and show how exciting data can be!

### **Email Genie 🧞‍♀️**

A classification project where I explore the Enron dataset and experiment with clustering and classification models to group emails based on their content. This project will also include a web app where users can enter a dummy email to test the model in real-time.
